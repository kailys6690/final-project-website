        <h1>Why are pets often left abandonded/neglected?</h1>
        <p>Dogs and cats are one of the most loveable creatures you can have in your life. The instant you have a pet in your life, you will fall in love immediately and can become the most life changing event. However, they need proper care and of course,
            all the attention they could get. However, most people don't treat them with love or care and are either left abandoned, neglected, or given to shelters. Some pets even get lost on accident or even purpose.</p>
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <li>The Animals that are in shelters come from the streets, abandoned homes, or the owner bring their pets because they don't want them anymore. </li>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <li>The animals (cats and dogs) that haven’t been adopted or have stayed too long in the shelter are put down. Each year, an estimate of 2.7 million dogs and cats are killed due to these circumstances. </li>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <li>It is estimated that 70 million stray animals are living in the United States and only out of the 70 million stray’s, only six to eight million cats and dogs enter the shelters.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <li>In the year 2007, there were around 1,880 animal abuse cases reported. Of these 1, 212 dogs were reported with some sort of animal cruelty cases. 337 cats suffered at the hands of mindless humans and over 470 other animal species were reported
                to have suffered from some sort of cruelty. </li>
